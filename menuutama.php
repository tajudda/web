          FT Project is a company engaged in the creative industry in Indonesia. 
          It has been two years since the company was established and some of our production is as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Home Vectors, or can be called products that move in the field of editing vector.
              Our company is arguably the largest home vector in Indonesia because we are a combination of people who have long moved or expert in this field.
            </li>
            <li>
              Video editing, we accept all forms of order to edit video in various duration and according to request.  
              But that does not contain racist elements and other negative elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Animation, in today's world especially in Indonesia the art of animation is very much sought or used because the content 
              is light and easily digested various circles. Therefore we also accept all forms of animation making orders. 
              But that does not contain racist elements and other negative elements.
            </li>
          </ol>
